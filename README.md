What is normalization?


It is a process of analyzing the given relation schemas based on their functional dependencies and primary keys to achieve the following desirable properties: 
1) Minimizing Redundancy 
2) Minimizing the Insertion, Deletion, And Update Anomalies 
Relation schemas that do not meet the properties are decomposed into smaller relation schemas that could meet desirable properties.
